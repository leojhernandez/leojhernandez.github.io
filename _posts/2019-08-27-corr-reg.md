# Cost of Living in NYC
### R notebook using data from Numbeo.
Overview: In this project I will explore the cost of living index for multiple cities and how they compare to one another using R. I will be using linear regression model to examine the relation between each index variable. Keep in mind, this is my first post and many updates will be coming!

Data Source:[Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_current.jsp)


R
```r
cost <- read.table('Cost_of_Living_2013.txt', sep='\t', header=T)
```
